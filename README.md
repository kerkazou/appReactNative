# 🍽️ Meals App

Meals App is a simple mobile application built with **React Native** and **TypeScript** that allows users to browse meals, filter them, and view detailed information about each meal.

The application retrieves meals from an API, assigns a price to each meal, and displays them in a clean and user-friendly list format. Users can filter meals by **name** and **price range**, navigate through pages, and open a **meal detail page** for more information.
